Project Implementation-

~ Linear Regression : It is an algorithm which we use to relate two variables.
I thus coded a model , trained it and then got the values of theta.

Rms Error : 5230.5


~ Polynomial Regression : It is an algorithm which is used to predict value one 
variable (Y) using feathers and their nth degree.
I coded and trained my model , finally got the maximum accuracy at n=3, and
thus got the theta values.

Error : 4.22%
ie Accuracy : 95.78%


~ Logistic Regression : It is an algorithm which is used to predict the value of
variable in the range of (0,1) using sigmoid function.I coded a model , trained
it , got values of theta then got the hypothisis. Now I used sigmoid function
to find the maxmimum probability and thus found the accuracy at the end.

Error : 15.96%
ie Accuracy = 84.04%


~ KNN : K - Nearest Neighbors is used to group the data given based on maximum
similarirty.I found k based on Eculidean distance calculation and 

my Accuracy was : 79.9%


~ K-means Clustering : It is a model which grouped the given data into clusters
for data given. I made a cluster of 50 for the dataset as at k = 50 N , I got

an Accuracy of : 40.6% 

~Neural Network : It is a model which predicts outputs for the given inputs.It 
consists of one input layer, one output layer and one hidden layer.
